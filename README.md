tennis club website for milestone 1 project

User Experience

Strategy

Why make this tennis club website?

There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
The club also wishes to retain members and to improve their skill level to enhance club
reputation during interclub matches. Increased reputation will attract more members.
Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts). The building
is also available for hire which helps to generate revenue.

Scope

Which features should be included in the website's design?

Members must be kept informed of practice times and contact details.
Data on typical numbers of players at each event should be included as this
encourages participation.
New members must be able to sign up for membership, both adults and children.
Information on competition and social events must be accessible or displayed.
Membership prices should be available including a free month's trial.
Contact information should be accessible. A link to the head coach's website.
A link to the membership secretary and a link to enquire about building hire.
Plenty of pictures of the refurbished courts and spacious clubhouse is a must.

Structure

How is the information structured and logically grouped?

The website consists of four pages. The home page (introduction, hero image, mission statement)
followed by a page focussed on adult members and new members (with sign up form) and a juniors
page also for members and new members (also with sign up form). The last page is a gallery page
to show the club and players. All pages have the same header and footer. Information structure
is altered slightly to allow for display on different types of devices i.e. responsive design.

Skeleton

How will information be represented and how will the user navigate to the information and features?

The wireframe view of the website is provided [A link to wireframes](Tennis_club.pdf)
In the header, links are provided to all other pages of the website from each page that is visited.
In the footer, linnks to social media are provided, plus links to head coach's page, venue hire
and local weather forecast.


Surface

What colours, typography and design elements are used?

Colours must contrast with background images. Consistent use of colour and typography and alignment
should be used across the website.
Design elements to be used are:-
Boiler plate to begin the code.
Header, section and footer elements in the body.
Bootstrap items such as buttons, forms, barchart, timeline, grid

Credits:

The Albert Lawn Tennis Club for its three ethos statements

the webthought.blogspots.com for its bar chart code. This did not work properly for this website 
and was modified quite a lot, but provided a good starting point.

w3schools.com was very useful for quick look-ups of code that had been covered by Code Institute's
course.

Improvements to code and website layout

The code and website was improved by grouping together each ethos statement with its associated
paragraph. This was previously a problem when adapting the website for responsive design.

The layout was improved by completely moving the ethos statements and paragraphs at smaller
screen sizes so that they sat underneath the hero-image. if this was not done, the website 
looked messy.
