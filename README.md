# tennis_club
tennis club website for milestone 1 project

## User Experience

### Why make this tennis club website?

* There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
* The club also wishes to retain its members and encourage participation in events.
* The club would like to improve members' skill level (this helps improve position in league tables).
This enhances club reputation and improving reputation will attract more members.
* Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts). 
* The building is also available for hire which helps to generate revenue.

The wireframe view of the website is provided in Tennis_club.pdf [Link to wireframes](assets/docs/Tennis_club.pdf)

* Github
* Gitpod


## Deployment
The process of deploying the website is described in this section and instructions are provided for deployment of changes to website.
Changes to the website are made easier by having the Gitpod extension installed in Firefox or Chrome browser.
### How to install the Gitpod extension in Firefox
To install the Gitpod extension in Firefox, from the create new repository screen:-
1. In the menu at the top right, click on 'Add-ons', from there search 'addons.mozilla'.
2. Type in 'Gitpod' and the first result is the correct extension.
3. Click on the extension, then click 'Add to Firefox'
4. Confirm permissions
Gitpod will appear in Github as a green button when a repository is opened.
### How to install the Gitpod extension in Chrome
To install the Gitpod extension in Chrome, from the create new repository screen:-
1. Click on the three dots menu.
2. Go to 'More Tools'>Extensions.
3. Click on the hamburger menu, then click 'Open Chrome Web Store'
4. search for Gitpod, this gives only one result.
5. Click on 'Gitpod' and click 'Add to Chrome', then 'Add Extension'
Gitpod will appear in Github as a green button when a repository is opened.
### Deploying the Website
The website code was created in Gitpod, then all the files were saved. At the Gitpod commmand line:-
1. Git add (files)
2. git commit -m (leaving an additional commments on what was created or changed in ""s)
3. git push (this command transfers code fro Gitpod to the repository in Github)
4. On the Github site, the settings menu was selected, this displayed a new screen.
5. In the section called 'Github Pages' where it says 'Source', the main branch was selected (the default branch).
6. 'Save ' was clicked to display the URL of the website.
There is often a delay of up to 20 minutes before the website becomes available.
The address of this website is https://sanson0.github.io/tennis_club/
### Making changes to the website
Whenever new changes to the code are made (within the main branch), once these changes are saved, and commands git add, git commit and git push are used,
the changes to the website are automatically deployed (so they appear at the address https://sanson0.github.io/tennis_club/). Currently there is only one branch.
## Testing
Methods for testing of the website included:-
* clicking on page icon with magnifying glass within Gitpod screen to display website
* at the Gitpod comand line, typing 'python3 -m http.server' to display website in new screen
* when website deployed, opening it in Chrome and investigating it with web developer tools
* Web developer tools in Chrome have a device symbol, automatically scaling the screen for different widths of devices (responsiveness)
* checking HTML code using W3C HTML Validator
* checking CSS code using W3C CSS Validator
* checking performance of the website
### UX requirements vs website
## First impressions
First impressions of  the website:-
* The website must be inviting to new members and encourage current members to join practice sessions and social events.
* There must be plenty of opportunities to sign up for membership with a free trial thrown in.
* Text must be easy to read as there is a lot of information to make available.
* Photos must be sharp and appealing to the viewer.
* Contrasting colours should be used but not many of them.
* There should be consistency between website pages of headers/ footers/ style of presentation and colours.
Unfortunately, the first complete version of the website did not fulfil the criteria for a good first impression.
Many quite substantial changes were made, so a new wireframe was created to allow a comparison of old and new versions.
The wireframe view of the first complete version is provided in Tennis_club.pdf [Link to wireframe 1](assets/docs/Tennis_club.pdf)
The wireframe view of the second complete version is provided in Lindale tennis club finish.pdf [Link to wireframe 2](assets/docs/Lindale_tennis_club_finish.pdf)
1. A smaller number of contrasting colours were used consistently across all pages of the website.
2. There were too many photos in version 1 for the Home, Events and Junior pages. Only one photo remained in version 2 for each page, all main background photos.
3. Social media icons were kept in one row for all screen widths. This saves the irritation of scrolling down a long way.
4. Number of colours reduced in header. Only the current page link was highlighted (in orange).
5. The question "Why Play Tennis?" on the Home page was moved to the top of the background image, out of this image.
6. Text on the Home page background image was given a contrasting background colour to allow easy reading of text.
7. Background images for Events and Junior pages were given 50% shading, to allow white overlaid text to be easy to read.
8. An invitation to New Members Night was added to the base of the background image as this was missing.
9. Each icon within the tennis balls was moved to the front of the text statement so that icons are easy to align with each other.
10. The weather link was replaced by the the County League link as it is more important to show the club's good standing in the league.

Testing included checking that all necessary features were present within the website.

### Links
Links include:-
* links to pages within the website (Home, Events, Juniors, Gallery)
* links to social media, opening into a separate window
* link to weather page, opening into a separate window
* links to external websites opening into a blank page (sites for coaching, membership secretary and venue hire)
These all function correctly
### Sign-up forms
Forms should do the following:-
* Error message comes back if fields are left empty in the form and submitted.
* Error message comes back if incorrect email address is entered and submitted.
* Success message appears if correct details are entered and submitted.
These actions all have the correct response.
### hoverable dropdown menus
The dropdown menus (there are three in the website) should do the following:-
* all display additional information only when curser is close to the dropdown button
* display text that is easy to read 
### Responsive design
The website should adapt for different widths of devices eg. desktop, tablet and mobile.
* Text should be easy to read and stand out from any background images.
* Photos should be sharp and should resize if necessary for different screen widths (not left with almost blank part of image)
* Features of the website shoould not start to overlap each other or drop off the edges of the screen.
* Website should be simplified for narrow width devices.
* Website should not appear cluttered, dropdown menus utilised to help with this.
* Website should adapt smoothly when changing between different screen widths.
* Is the website easy and enjoyable for others to use?

The code and website was improved by grouping together each ethos statement with its associated
paragraph. The statements and paragraphs were separate when the website was first put together. 
This caused problems when adapting the website for responsive design.

The layout was improved by completely moving the position of ethos statements and paragraphs at smaller
screen sizes so that they sat underneath the background hero-image instead of being inside the hero-image.
If this was not done, the website looked messy.

A bug was found in the code related to the tennis balls on the home page. This caused them to move out of vertical
alignment when the website was displayed at different widths (on different devices). The code was simplified with 
help from mentor Nishant.
## Credits:
### Content
The Albert Lawn Tennis Club three ethos statements - fitness, fun and competition - were used in this website

css-tricks.com bar chart code was used in the Events page.

w3 schools for the hoverable dropdown menu using HTML and CSS only.
www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp 
the dropdown menu was adapted to display information instead of links, with changes to colours.
This was necessary because a lot of information needed to be present on the website without crowding it.
