tennis club website for milestone 1 project

User Experience

Strategy

Why make this tennis club website?

There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
The club also wishes to retain members and to improve their skill level to enhance club
reputation during interclub matches. Increased reputation will attract more members.
Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts). The building
is also available for hire which helps to generate revenue.

Scope

Which features should be included in the website's design?

Members must be kept informed of practice times and contact details.
Data on typical numbers of players at each event should be included as this
encourages participation.
New members must be able to sign up for membership, both adults and children.
Information on competition and social events must be accessible or displayed.
Membership prices should be available including a free month's trial.
Contact information should be accessible. A link to the head coach's website.
A link to the membership secretary and a link to enquire about building hire.
Plenty of pictures of the refurbished courts and spacious clubhouse is a must.

Structure

How is the information structured and logically grouped?

The website consists of four pages. The home page (introduction, hero image, mission statement)
followed by a page focussed on adult members and new members (with sign up form) and a juniors
page also for members and new members (also with sign up form). The last page is a gallery page
to show the club and players. All pages have the same header and footer. Information structure
is altered slightly to allow for display on different types of devices i.e. responsive design.

Skeleton

How will information be represented and how will the user navigate to the information and features?
