# tennis_club
tennis club website for milestone 1 project

## User Experience

### Why make this tennis club website?

* There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
* The club also wishes to retain its members and encourage participation in events.
* The club would like to improve members' skill level (this helps improve position in league tables).
This enhances club reputation and improving reputation will attract more members.
* Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts). 
* The building is also available for hire which helps to generate revenue.

The wireframe view of the website is provided [A link to wireframes](Tennis_club.pdf)

### Responsive design
Desktop, tablet and mobile

The code and website was improved by grouping together each ethos statement with its associated
paragraph. The statements and paragraphs were separate when the website was first put together. 
This caused problems when adapting the website for responsive design.

The layout was improved by completely moving the position of ethos statements and paragraphs at smaller
screen sizes so that they sat underneath the background hero-image instead of being inside the hero-image.
If this was not done, the website looked messy.
## Deployment

## Credits:
### Content
The Albert Lawn Tennis Club for its three ethos statements - fitness, fun and competition

the webthought.blogspots.com for its bar chart code. This did not work properly for this website 
and was modified quite a lot, but provided a good starting point. The bar chart consisted of HTML and CSS only, which
was useful because other computer languages are not covered this early in the course.

### Media
The Albert Lawn Tennis Club for allowing lots of photos of club and members to be used in this website.
