# tennis_club
tennis club website for milestone 1 project

## User Experience

### Why make this tennis club website?

* There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
* The club also wishes to retain its members and encourage participation in events.
* The club would like to improve members' skill level (this helps improve position in league tables).
This enhances club reputation and improving reputation will attract more members.
* Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts). 
* The building is also available for hire which helps to generate revenue.

The wireframe view of the website is provided in Tennis_club.pdf [Link to wireframes](assets/docs/Tennis_club.pdf)

## Features

### Which features should be included in the website's design?

### Generic features
* Consistent headers and footers must be used across all pages to allow easy use of the website.
* Headers contain links to the other pages in the website.
* Footers contain links to the head coach's website, membership secretary, weather plus social media.
* Responsive design is included for all pages to allow good display of the website on desktop, tablet and mobile phone.
* There are separate pages for adult and junior players because training and competition events are different.
* Consistency is needed between events page (for adult members) and juniors page making it easier for families to join.

Submit an incorrect email address and verify an error message comes back.
Submit a form with correct entries and verify a success message appears.
These actions all have the correct response.
### Responsive design
Desktop, tablet and mobile

The code and website was improved by grouping together each ethos statement with its associated
paragraph. The statements and paragraphs were separate when the website was first put together. 
This caused problems when adapting the website for responsive design.

The layout was improved by completely moving the position of ethos statements and paragraphs at smaller
screen sizes so that they sat underneath the background hero-image instead of being inside the hero-image.
If this was not done, the website looked messy.
## Deployment

## Credits:
### Content
The Albert Lawn Tennis Club three ethos statements - fitness, fun and competition - were used in this website

css-tricks.com bar chart code was used in the Events page.

w3 schools for the hoverable dropdown menu using HTML and CSS only.
www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp 
the dropdown menu was adapted to display information instead of links, with changes to colours.
This was necessary because a lot of information needed to be present on the website without crowding it.

### Media
Thanks to the Albert Lawn Tennis Club for allowing photos of the club and its members to be used in this website.
Opportunities for photos of club members playing and enjoying social events were limited due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Thanks to Freeimages for the photo on the Home page, and to Pixabay for photos on the Events page and Juniors page.
