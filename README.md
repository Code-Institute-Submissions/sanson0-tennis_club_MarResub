Strategy
There is a need for FAB tennis club to attract new members, both adults and children.
The club also wishes to retain members and to improve their skill level to enhance club
reputation during interclub matches. Increased reputation will attract more members.
Increasing membership is important to cover costs to maintain the club and facilities 
and pay for recent expensive improvements to the club (overhaul of courts).

Scope
Members must be kept informed of practice times and contact details.
Data on typical numbers of players at each event should be included as this
encourages participation.
New members must be able to sign up for membership, both adults and children.
Information on competition and social events must be accessible or displayed.
Membership prices should be available.
